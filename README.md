# Criminal Occurence

I guided a group of students in the development of this application for the management of criminal incidents for a police station.

Basically the application will manage at least up to three police departments at an early stage that are.

`Picket`, `Sic` and `Research`

## Start

To start the application first you need to install all project dependencies, use the following command to perform this activity.

```bash
composer install
```
Run in project directory

Then just access the browser and the project route will be loaded.
